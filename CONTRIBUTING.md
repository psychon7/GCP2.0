## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a **Git Flow** branching model:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

### Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our style guidelines

3. **Add tests** for your changes

4. **Run the test suite** to ensure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd backend && pytest
   
   # Frontend tests
   cd frontend && npm test
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** using our commit guidelines

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** to the `develop` branch

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting

```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Check style
flake8 .
```

### JavaScript Code Style

- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting

```bash

# Check style
npm run lint
```

### Documentation Style

```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
