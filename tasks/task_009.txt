# Task ID: 9
# Title: Database and Messaging Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and NATS infrastructure
# Details:
Configure and deploy the necessary data infrastructure: TimescaleDB 2.15 (PostgreSQL 16 extension) for time-series data, PostgreSQL 16 for relational data, Redis 7 for caching, and NATS JetStream 3.x for messaging. Set up appropriate schemas, tables, and indexes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify database performance metrics, message throughput, and system stability under load.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Deploy PostgreSQL 16 with TimescaleDB 2.15 Extension [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure PostgreSQL 16 database server with TimescaleDB 2.15 extension for time-series data storage
### Details:
Install PostgreSQL 16 on the target environment. Configure memory, connections, and performance parameters based on system resources. Install TimescaleDB 2.15 extension. Set up appropriate backup and recovery mechanisms. Configure network access and security settings including firewall rules and SSL certificates. Document connection strings and access credentials in the secure team repository.

## 2. Configure PostgreSQL Database Schemas and Tables [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the relational database schemas, tables, and indexes for the application data model
### Details:
Create database schemas according to the application domain boundaries. Implement tables with appropriate columns, data types, and constraints. Set up foreign key relationships between tables. Create indexes for frequently queried columns. Implement partitioning strategies for large tables if needed. Configure user roles and permissions with principle of least privilege. Document the schema design with entity-relationship diagrams.

## 3. Set up Redis 7 Caching Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deploy and configure Redis 7 for application caching needs
### Details:
Install Redis 7 on the target environment. Configure memory limits, eviction policies, and persistence options. Set up Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster for high availability if required. Implement security measures including authentication and network restrictions. Define key naming conventions and TTL (Time-To-Live) policies for different types of cached data. Document Redis configuration and access methods for the development team.

## 4. Deploy NATS JetStream 3.x Messaging System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up NATS JetStream 3.x for reliable messaging and event streaming
### Details:
Install NATS Server with JetStream 3.x enabled. Configure server resources, limits, and storage options. Set up clustering for high availability if required. Define security policies including authentication and authorization. Configure network settings and TLS for secure communication. Document connection details, authentication methods, and basic usage patterns for the development team.

## 5. Implement Data Infrastructure Integration and Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate all data infrastructure components and set up comprehensive monitoring
### Details:
Create connection libraries and configuration files for application services to access all data infrastructure components. Implement health check endpoints for each component. Set up monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana dashboards. Configure alerts for critical metrics like disk usage, memory consumption, connection counts, and error rates. Document operational procedures for maintenance, backup/restore, and troubleshooting. Create runbooks for common failure scenarios.
