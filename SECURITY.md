## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

**🔒 For Security Issues:**
- **Email**: [security@gcp3.org](mailto:security@gcp3.org)
- **PGP Key**: Available at [https://gcp3.org/pgp-key.asc](https://gcp3.org/pgp-key.asc)
- **Bug Bounty**: [HackerOne Program](https://hackerone.com/gcp3) (when available)

**❌ Do NOT:**
- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Discuss the vulnerability publicly before it's been addressed
- Attempt to exploit the vulnerability beyond what's necessary to demonstrate it

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and affected systems
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code
5. **Environment**: Affected versions, browsers, or configurations
6. **Contact**: Your preferred contact method for follow-up

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding quickly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 90 days
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is deployed

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Report Received**: We acknowledge receipt and begin investigation
2. **Validation**: We validate and assess the severity of the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Fix Deployment**: We deploy the fix to production
5. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability (typically 90 days after fix)
6. **Credit**: We provide credit to the reporter (if desired)

### Severity Classification

We use the CVSS v3.1 scoring system:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Immediate action required
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Fix within 7 days
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Fix within 30 days
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Fix within 90 days

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to the repository
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data

### Development Environment

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration
- **Local Security**: Secure your development environment
- **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
- **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite

### Research Data Security

- **Consent**: Ensure proper consent for all data collection
- **Anonymization**: Anonymize personal data before processing
- **Access Control**: Limit access to research data on a need-to-know basis
- **Retention**: Follow data retention policies and delete data when no longer needed

## Security Tools and Processes

### Automated Security

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing in CI/CD
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
