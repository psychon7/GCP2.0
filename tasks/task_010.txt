# Task ID: 10
# Title: CI/CD, Monitoring, and Infrastructure as Code
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and IaC for VPS deployment
# Details:
Set up Docker, Helm, k3s, GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Implement Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring. Create infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts for deploying the entire system on a single VPS with a clear path to horizontal scaling.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the entire system can be deployed on a single VPS with OPEX ≤€120/month. Test system monitoring and alerting functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Docker and k3s on VPS [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure Docker and k3s on the VPS to create a lightweight Kubernetes environment for container orchestration.
### Details:
Install Docker on the VPS. Install k3s as a lightweight Kubernetes distribution. Configure k3s for single-node deployment with appropriate resource limits. Set up kubectl for remote management. Document the installation process and configuration settings for future reference.

## 2. Create Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop IaC scripts using Terraform or similar tools to automate the provisioning and configuration of the VPS infrastructure.
### Details:
Choose appropriate IaC tool (Terraform recommended). Create scripts to provision VPS resources including networking, storage, and security configurations. Implement modular design to support future horizontal scaling. Include configuration for DNS, SSL certificates, and load balancing. Document the IaC architecture and usage instructions.

## 3. Implement Helm charts for application deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create Helm charts to package and deploy the application components to the k3s cluster with consistent configuration.
### Details:
Design Helm chart structure for all application components. Create templates for deployments, services, ingress, and other Kubernetes resources. Implement configurable values for different environments. Set up appropriate resource requests and limits. Include health checks and readiness probes. Document chart usage and customization options.

## 4. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create GitHub Actions workflows to automate building, testing, and deploying the application to the k3s cluster.
### Details:
Create workflow files for CI/CD pipeline. Implement stages for code linting, testing, building Docker images, and deploying to k3s. Set up environment-specific configurations and secrets management. Configure automated versioning and tagging. Implement rollback mechanisms for failed deployments. Document the CI/CD process and troubleshooting steps.

## 5. Implement Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Set up Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization to monitor the health and performance of the application and infrastructure.
### Details:
Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Helm charts. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from application components and infrastructure. Set up alerting rules for critical conditions. Create Grafana dashboards for system metrics, application performance, and business KPIs. Implement log aggregation and correlation with metrics. Document monitoring setup and alert response procedures.
