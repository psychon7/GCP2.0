# Task ID: 2
# Title: Edge Entropy Extraction Agent
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a Rust-based agent that pulls frames from camera feeds and extracts entropy via SHA-3 512-bit hash digests
# Details:
Implement a high-performance Rust agent that pulls frames from cameras at 1-30 FPS, processes them for entropy, and outputs SHA-3 512-bit hash samples. The agent should achieve <100ms latency from frame capture to hash digest delivery via NATS.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that hash digests arrive via NATS topic 'entropy.raw.<id>' within 100ms after frame capture. Ensure entropy extraction meets the target of ≥256 bits/node/sec with NIST SP-800-22 pass rate ≥99%.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Camera Frame Capture Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Rust module that can connect to and pull frames from camera feeds at configurable frame rates (1-30 FPS).
### Details:
Use the `v4l` (Video4Linux) or similar crates for Linux camera access, or platform-specific alternatives. Implement a configurable frame rate limiter to control capture frequency. Design the module to handle multiple camera sources and expose a clean API that returns frame data as bytes. Include error handling for camera disconnections and permission issues.

## 2. Develop Frame Processing Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a processing pipeline that prepares captured frames for entropy extraction by applying necessary transformations.
### Details:
Implement frame preprocessing including optional resizing, grayscale conversion, and noise filtering to optimize for entropy extraction. Use Rust image processing libraries like `image` crate. Design the pipeline to be configurable and efficient, with minimal memory allocations. Consider using parallel processing for performance optimization.

## 3. Implement SHA-3 Entropy Extraction [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create an entropy extraction module that applies SHA-3 512-bit hashing to processed frames.
### Details:
Use the `sha3` crate or RustCrypto libraries for SHA-3 implementation. Design the module to efficiently process frame data and generate 512-bit hash digests. Implement options for extracting entropy from specific regions of frames or applying additional entropy concentration techniques before hashing. Optimize for performance to minimize latency.

## 4. Develop NATS Integration for Hash Delivery [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement a NATS client module that publishes extracted entropy hash digests with minimal latency.
### Details:
Use the `async-nats` crate for NATS integration. Implement asynchronous publishing of hash digests to configurable NATS subjects. Include connection management, reconnection logic, and error handling. Design for minimal latency between hash generation and publication. Add configurable options for message format and metadata inclusion.

## 5. Create Main Agent with Configuration and Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Develop the main agent application that integrates all components with configuration, monitoring, and performance optimization.
### Details:
Implement a configurable agent that integrates all modules. Create a configuration system supporting file-based and environment variable configuration. Add performance monitoring to track latency at each stage of the pipeline. Implement graceful shutdown and resource cleanup. Optimize for overall performance to achieve <100ms end-to-end latency. Include logging and optional metrics exposure via Prometheus or similar.
