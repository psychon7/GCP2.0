# Task ID: 1
# Title: Camera Management Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a Camera Management service that handles discovery, validation, and health monitoring of public camera streams
# Details:
Implement a Python-based service that discovers, validates, and maintains a healthy pool of at least 100 public camera streams. Core functionality includes discovery workers for sources (DOT, EarthCam, Insecam, Shodan), benchmark workers to validate stream quality, entropy quality testing, health monitoring, and a FastAPI server for camera endpoint exposure.

# Test Strategy:
Validate that the service maintains at least 100 active cameras with â‰¥80% availability and geographic diversity. Verify camera benchmarking completes in <30s per camera.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Camera Stream Discovery Workers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create worker modules that discover public camera streams from multiple sources including DOT, EarthCam, Insecam, and Shodan.
### Details:
Develop a modular discovery system with separate worker classes for each source (DOTDiscoveryWorker, EarthCamDiscoveryWorker, etc.). Each worker should implement a common interface with methods for authentication (if needed), search, and stream URL extraction. Use aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests to maximize throughput. Store discovered stream URLs in a database with source metadata, timestamp, and initial status flags.

## 2. Develop Stream Validation and Benchmarking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a validation system that tests discovered camera streams for accessibility, quality, and usability metrics.
### Details:
Implement a StreamValidator class using OpenCV to connect to streams and validate them. Measure key metrics: connection success rate, latency, frame rate, resolution, and stream stability. Create an entropy-based quality assessment algorithm to evaluate image clarity and usefulness. Use a worker pool pattern to process multiple validations concurrently. Update the database with validation results and quality scores.

## 3. Build Health Monitoring and Maintenance System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Develop a health monitoring system that regularly checks camera stream availability and maintains a healthy pool of working streams.
### Details:
Create a HealthMonitor class that periodically checks stream health using the validation system. Implement exponential backoff for failed streams and prioritization logic to maintain at least 100 healthy streams. Design a maintenance scheduler that balances monitoring frequency based on stream reliability history. Implement automatic pruning of consistently failing streams and prioritized discovery to replace them.

## 4. Create Database Models and Storage Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Design and implement the database schema and storage layer for camera stream metadata, validation results, and health status.
### Details:
Use SQLAlchemy to create models for CameraStream, ValidationResult, and HealthStatus. Implement repository pattern classes (StreamRepository, ValidationRepository) that handle database operations. Design indexes for efficient querying by location, quality score, and health status. Implement data retention policies for historical validation data. Create migration scripts for schema evolution.

## 5. Develop FastAPI Server for Camera Stream Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Create a REST API server that exposes endpoints for camera stream discovery, filtering, and status information.
### Details:
Implement a FastAPI application with endpoints for: listing available streams with filtering options (by location, quality, status), retrieving detailed stream information, triggering validation for specific streams, and providing health metrics of the overall system. Implement pagination for large result sets, request validation, proper error handling, and API documentation using OpenAPI. Add authentication middleware for secure access to management endpoints.
